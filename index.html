            <h2> <ins> <i> WHY TO BOYCOTT ISRAEL PRODUCTS </i></ins></h2><br>
        </center>
        <p>Boycotting <strong> Israeli products </strong> is often advocated as a form of protest against its government's
            policies towards Palestinians. By refusing to support companies operating in Israeli
            settlements, individuals aim to pressure for change and show solidarity with those affected
            by the conflict. Critics argue this tactic may harm Israeli and Palestinian workers alike
            and hinder prospects for peace. Yet, proponents see it as a nonviolent means to address
            human rights violations. Ultimately, the decision to boycott is a complex moral and
            political choice, reflecting individuals' beliefs in justice and the power of economic
            activism.</p>
        <p>
            A boycott can also put pressure on companies whose exports are linked to some of the most evident aspects of the
            Israeli occupation and apartheid. To identify <strong> Israeli products </strong> you can check products barcodes 
            such as <blockquote cite="https://www.ipsc.ie/campaigns/consumer-boycott"><p>The Israeli barcode starts with the numbers <b> 729</b>. However, it doesn’t 
                necessarily appear on all <strong>Israeli products </strong>so be sure to <i> always check the label or ask your 
                supplier for country of origin.</i></p></blockquote> <br>
        </p>
        <p>The Israeli boycott campaign is gaining momentum with time, putting pressure on Israel for its human rights violations.
             People in Pakistan have also shunned Israeli and international companies in the wake of the <acronym title="Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction"> BDS </acronym> movement.
            McDonald’s, Nestlé, Pepsi, Fiverr, and Amazon are among the most well-known pro-Israel brands 
            and companies in Pakistan.</p>
